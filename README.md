Let’s Dive into the concept--------------------------------------->
Suppose V-mart is a e-commerce company located in the heart of Kolkata city. They sell clothes online, but also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.Indians & mostly foreign Customers walk into these sessions, meet with their stylist, then place orders for clothing either their mobile app or on the website of V-mart.


Now suppose V-mart hire you as a data scientist to take a business decision.

  Here is the question they want answered:

  "Should we focus our efforts more on the mobile app or on the website?"

To help you make this decision, the company has provided you with a CSV file that contains statistics on how each customer uses their mobile app and their website.
